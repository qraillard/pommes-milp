# POMMES-MILP - Planning and Operation Model for Multi-Energy Systems (with MILP)

[POMMES](https://git.persee.minesparis.psl.eu/energy-alternatives/pommes) is an open source framework to model investment pathways in multi-energy systems.
The framework enables to minimise the system costs to meet the energy services demand by modelling the investment
and operating costs of energy conversion, storage and transport technologies.

POMMES-MILP integrates a selection of POMMES modules (pulled from [version 0.2.3](https://git.persee.minesparis.psl.eu/energy-alternatives/pommes/-/tree/5df6a4683cb1767fa7a17284c5afe3abf35abf33) in July 2025)—some of which have been adapted—alongside two new modules (one explicitly using MILP).

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Install [Miniconda3 distribution](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

Choose the installation depending on your platform.

To integrate conda in PowerShell, run in the `Anaconda Prompt`:

    ```

### Python environment creation
Ensure Conda is initiated in your shell: see [prerequisites](#prerequisites) if needed.

Download the file
[`environment.yaml`](https://git.persee.minesparis.psl.eu/energy-alternatives/pommes/-/blob/2e4613d9a7aa3f64485d59b683174a9a9ebb3da7/ci/envs/environment-all.yaml).

To create the environment, run in the file directory:

```bash
$ conda env create -f environment-all.yaml
```
