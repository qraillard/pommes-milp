Methodology
***********

In this guide, we will describe in detail the methodology adopted to model planning and operation
of multi-energy systems. In the first section, the optimisation problem equations are listed.
The nomenclature bridges the notations in the equations and the variables and parameters names.

Their implementation in ``linopy`` are then presented with a description of the input dataset.
